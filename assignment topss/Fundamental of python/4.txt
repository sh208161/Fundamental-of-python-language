How the memory is managed in python
->  In Python, memory management is handled by the Python memory manager, which manages the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically. It uses reference counting to keep track of the number of references to objects. When the reference count drops to zero, the memory is deallocated. Additionally, Python has a built-in garbage collector that handles circular references, cleaning up objects that are no longer in use but are part of reference cycles. This automatic memory management simplifies coding by reducing the need for manual memory handling.
